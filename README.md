This project was done for HR advisories to detect possible employees who might end up quitting the organisation.
The data was sourced from the HRMS portal where the details of all the past and current employees were been recorded for the past 15 years.
In this project the outcome is a classification where we judge if an employee is likely to quit the job or not.
